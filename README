Payment
=======

Small Rails plugin for convenient work with money-like column types.

For a columns named like 'pay_*' or '*_pay', adds corresponding methods
'payment_*' or '*_payment', which work with object of Payment::Money class.
This class behaves much as native Float, but also handles rounding issues.
Also, when doing assignment, plugin performs banker's rounding by default


Installation

`rails plugin install git@github.com:akuzko/payment.git`


Example
=======

class Pay < ActiveRecord::Base
  # has fields pay_amount:decimal(10,2), total_pay:decimal(10,2)
end

Pay.create :pay_amount => 12.3456, :total_pay => 34.5678
pay = Pay.last
pay.pay_amount.class # => BigDecimal
pay.pay_amount.to_f # => 12.35 - rounding performed by DB
pay.payment_amount.class # => Payment::Money
pay.payment_amount = 12.345
pay.pay_amount.to_f # => 12.34 - rounding performed by money proxy (half-even banker's rounding)

pay.total_payment # => 34.57
pay.total_payment do |float|
  # some calculations on float value
  float * 33.567
end
